# Project Proposal

## Abstract
This project investigates whether deep learning models, specifically LSTM and XGBoost, can enhance short- to medium-term market timing strategies for highly liquid technology stocks (the "Magnificent 7"). By integrating historical price data, technical indicators, macroeconomic variables, and sentiment signals, we aim to develop a robust, interpretable trading strategy that outperforms traditional approaches. The project will deliver a reproducible framework, initial results, and actionable insights for AI-driven investment decision-making.

## Introduction
Financial markets are increasingly volatile and complex, making effective market timing a significant challenge. Recent advances in machine learning, particularly deep learning, have shown promise in extracting predictive patterns from large, diverse datasets. This project explores the application of LSTM and XGBoost models to forecast directional price movements for the Magnificent 7 stocks, leveraging a combination of technical, macroeconomic, and sentiment features. Our goal is to design, implement, and evaluate a data-driven trading strategy that addresses current pain-points in financial engineering and contributes to the growing field of AI in finance.

## Theoretical Framework
Recent advances in deep learning have enabled the modeling of complex, nonlinear relationships in financial time series. LSTM networks are particularly effective at capturing temporal dependencies in historical price data, as demonstrated by Aldhyani & Alzahrani (2022) and Shahbandari et al. (2024), who achieved high predictive accuracy on stocks like Tesla, Apple, and Amazon. Integrating sentiment analysis from news and social media, as shown by Ouf et al. (2024) and Gu et al. (2024), further improves model performance, with XGBoost and LSTM both benefiting from these features. Hybrid models that combine macroeconomic indicators with micro-level stock data, such as the MambaLLM framework (Lu et al., 2025), have shown significant reductions in prediction error. However, challenges remain in interpretability, real-time sentiment integration, and robust backtesting. This project builds on these findings by combining technical, macroeconomic, and sentiment features in a unified, interpretable framework for market timing.

## Methodology
### Data Sources
- Daily historical price and volume data for the Magnificent 7 stocks (AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN, META, TSLA, MELI) from Yahoo Finance or similar APIs
- Macroeconomic indicators (e.g., interest rates, inflation) from FRED or equivalent
- Sentiment data from news APIs and social media (e.g., Twitter, FinBERT)

### Feature Engineering
- Technical indicators: moving averages, RSI, MACD, volatility, etc.
- Macroeconomic features: interest rates, inflation, unemployment, etc.
- Sentiment features: polarity scores from news and social media

### Model Training
- LSTM and XGBoost models for directional price prediction
- Train/test split with cross-validation
- Hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance

### Evaluation Metrics
- Classification: F1 score, accuracy, precision, recall
- Financial: Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown, cumulative returns

### Backtesting
- Implement a realistic trading strategy using model predictions
- Backtest on historical data to assess profitability and risk

### Tools
- Python, JupyterLab, pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, xgboost, tensorflow, matplotlib

## Results
This section will present the initial results from our data analysis and model experiments. It will include:
- Summary tables of model performance (F1 score, accuracy, Sharpe ratio, etc.)
- Key figures and plots (e.g., price predictions vs. actual, confusion matrices, cumulative returns)
- Interpretation of preliminary findings and their implications for the trading strategy

*Results will be updated as the project progresses and more experiments are conducted.*

## Discussion
This section will analyze and interpret the results in the context of the research question and the literature reviewed. It will address:
- How well the models performed compared to traditional benchmarks
- The impact of different feature sets (technical, macroeconomic, sentiment)
- Limitations and challenges encountered
- How the findings relate to or differ from previous studies

*Discussion will be expanded as more results become available.*

## Conclusion
This section will summarize the main findings and their implications for market timing strategies and AI-driven investment. It will highlight:
- The effectiveness of deep learning models for short- to medium-term prediction
- Practical takeaways for financial engineers and investors
- Suggestions for future research and improvements

*Conclusion will be finalized after all results and discussion are complete.*
